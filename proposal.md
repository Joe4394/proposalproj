# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Blackjack

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Make a blackjack game with pygame. If there is enough time, skew odds for certain events.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software will do everything you would expect in a game of blackjack. This means dealing cards, allowing the user to stand or hit, allowing them to double and hit, etc. It will follow the rules of blackjack as well for both the dealer and the user/users. The dealer will always be a computer. It will be animated with pygame so it is more interactive and engaging.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A working game of blackjack

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A working game with more options including different chip amounts and player amounts

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The same as the better outcome but also makes the game skewed against the user but not enough for them to notice.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will be learning how to use pygame. While it is Python-based, I know practically nothing about this service or how to use it. It is a completely new field for me so I expect there to be a big learning curve for me. I have never animated/made a game before so this will be a big learning experience in that field as well.
